I will get everything using the api call ticker:

https://api.coinmarketcap.com/v2/ticker/?sort=id

since its accurate and gets everything they have in the api. I need to show
50 most valuable cryptocurrencies, thats the problem, since api does not have
the sort option to actually sort the criptocurrencies by their price.
